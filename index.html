        <p>I am a sweet, handsome, loving girl, looking for a family to call my own. I LOVE pets, but am worried about the big world around me. Limiting me to one room of your home (at first) will help me feel safe. I will need daily interaction with you as I get used to my new life. Need some biscuits with your breakfast? I’m an expert kneader! Cheek and chin scratches make me so happy! I have an excellent purr!</p>

        <p>I came all the way to OHS through the Second Chance Program. My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet! It is unknown if I have ever lived with other animals or children. I am eager to learn and a Basic Manners class may be just the right thing for us! I really enjoy playing with toys! I’ll let you know my favorite one when we meet! I am not one to sit still! I will flourish in a home with someone that will keep me mentally and physically active! Not only do I pull on heart strings, but I also pull on leashes! I will need someone to help me with my leash manners. My rough and tumble play style may not be the right match for all dogs.

        <p>Hay, fresh greens, fiber-rich pellets and fresh water are the key things to keep my healthy! I will enjoy daily enrichment through regular play time, exercise and bunny-friendly toys! Along with routine vet checks, I will also need regular grooming and nail trims. I am bonded to Ginger. We must go home together and our adoption fee includes both of us.</p>
